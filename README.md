# A Troubled Double!

A Troubled Double was a game initially made for Game Endeavor's 5th Community Game Jam. 

The team at Nahar and I loved the concept and vibe so much we felt we could do it justice by fixing it up and making a much more polished version of it.

The original is available here: https://barwani.itch.io/a-troubled-double

The remake is still in development, but currently completed improvements are:

- Fixed issues with visual clarity and FPS affecting trajectory
- Improved design of all existing levels
- Reworked UI
- Remade all assets (sprites still not complete)
- Fixed (many) bugs
